It outlines the Brazilian government's efforts to decentralize financial management to improve school conditions through the Programa de Descentraliza\u00e7\u00e3o Administrativa e Financeira (PDAF) and the subsequent audits revealing ongoing deficiencies. The text details the innovative 'Controllership in Schools' initiative launched by the Comptroller General of the Federal District (CGDF) to involve students in auditing their schools' infrastructure, identifying issues, and proposing solutions. This initiative, aligned with the National Social Participation Policy (PNPS) and part of the #TodosJuntosContraCorrupcao campaign, demonstrated significant success in fostering civic education and improving school conditions. The initiative's expansion and the use of the Promise Tracker app developed by the MIT Center for Civic Media for data collection are also discussed, showcasing the project's scalability and impact on promoting transparency, accountability, and student participation in school management.\n\n    Chapter (Content) The Struggle for Resources in Brazilian Public Schools\n    At a 2016 event for Brazil's new transparency portal, a Gama high school director lamented the government's insufficient funding, detailing personal sacrifices for school needs - Edgard Vasconcelos of CED Casa Grande.\n\nA 2007 decree granted Brazil's public schools financial autonomy to meet local needs, aiming for responsive school management through the PDAF program.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2016, public schools received over R$ 445 million for upkeep, with R$ 84 million in 2016 alone. Yet, audits revealed nationwide school infrastructure issues, attributed to funding shortages, corruption, and student behavior, with specific problems like those at Casa Grande high school in Gama lacking detailed investigation. School heads report funding delays, while officials blame schools.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Controllership in Schools: A Civic Education Initiative in Brazil\n    In 2016, the CGDF initiated the (Controllership in Schools) to involve students from 10 Brazilian public schools in auditing their infrastructure, identifying issues, and promoting civic education, aligning with the PNPS to combat corruption through transparent public spending and societal involvement. This was part of the #TodosJuntosContraCorrupcao campaign by ENCCLA, selecting 22 out of over 90 proposals. Students were tasked with documenting local school issues, determining their causes, and suggesting solutions. In the pilot, students from 10 schools, including Edgard\u2019s CED Casa Grande, reported over 600 problems like burnt light bulbs, missing fire extinguishers, and broken chairs, and provided feedback on various aspects including transportation and educational material quality. The CGDF consolidated these findings and feedback into detailed reports with images, descriptions, and deadlines for the education department. Following the audit, the Comptroller General monitored the resolution of these issues, noting that in one school, 115 problems were identified and 45% were resolved within 3 months by the education department or by the students and school management.",

As educators, researchers, and innovators, they aim to counteract the predictive impact of poverty and race on children's life outcomes by using a diverse portfolio of resources to change students' experiences. An example of educational activities includes students racing to answer a question during their third-grade science class at J.M. Ullom Elementary.\n\n  Chapter (Content) The Evolution and Impact of The New Teacher Project (TNTP)\n  Michelle Rhee and like-minded educators founded The New Teacher Project (TNTP) to ensure all students have excellent teachers. TNTP launched a program to prepare individuals with strong subject knowledge for teaching in high-need schools, partnering with urban districts like Baltimore, New Orleans, NYC, and D.C., and starting the Baltimore City Teaching Residency. It published its first policy report to address urban teacher shortages and proposed reforms for better teacher-school matches. Former educator Laura Bush donated proceeds from 'Read All About It' to TNTP, now active in 24 districts, providing hands-on consulting in cities including Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and others. TNTP released publications on NYC's mutual consent in teacher hiring and exposed the national failure to recognize and act on teacher effectiveness differences.\n\nTNTP highlighted the issue of treating teachers as interchangeable, began partnerships with state education departments and charter organizations, and was renamed to TNTP, reflecting a broader mission beyond teacher recruitment and training. It expanded its focus to include school culture, leadership, teacher retention, and compensation.\n\nForbes recognized TNTP for incorporating flex time and remote work. TNTP made Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion an organizational imperative, aiming for leadership that mirrors the communities served, and grew its client base to over 30 cities.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Educational Initiatives and Findings on Improving School Preparedness and Equity\n  We detail why some graduates are ill-prepared for college/career, citing lack of grade-appropriate tasks, strong teaching, engagement, and high expectations.

It outlines the challenges faced by citizens in holding government accountable due to a lack of clear mechanisms for tracking infrastructure projects and the absence of a right to information bill. TransGov addresses these issues by offering a way for citizens to track public projects, report service delivery faults, and interact directly with the relevant government departments. The platform has grown to 600,000 registered users and operates with a small team. The text also discusses the challenges in engaging citizens and government departments, the strategies used to overcome these challenges, and the impact of TransGov on improving government responsiveness and citizen participation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) TransGov Ghana: Empowering Citizens through Technology\n    TransGov Ghana, launched in 2014 specifically to help Ghanaians monitor the progress of local development projects, addresses citizens' unawareness of accountability for project and service issues by curating a list of local development projects for feedback. It enables users to comment, give feedback on projects, report infrastructure issues like burst pipelines or potholes, and track the status of complaints, fostering community engagement. With 600,000 users, feedback is facilitated through its website, app, SMS, or phone. A 6-person team, responsible for technology, management, and communications, runs the platform.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Access to Information on Local Infrastructure Projects in Ghana: Challenges and Implications\n    In Ghana, no official ways exist for citizens to access local project details. Despite four years of deliberation, the right to Information bill's passage remains uncertain. As an Open Government Partnership member, Ghana's national data portal claims \"133 datasets,\" yet only 15, mainly census data, are viewable or downloadable and seldom updated. Without an information right bill or effective data portal, Ghanaians must directly request information from relevant government officials.\n\nThis creates two issues: identifying the responsible government authority for a project is often difficult, and citizens must locate the specific departmental individual handling the project or information. This ambiguity and lack of accountability frequently leave citizen inquiries unresolved, fostering government apathy.\n\n    Chapter (Content) TransGov: Enhancing Public Service Delivery and Transparency\n    TransGov has two roles: 1) It tracks and shares details of public projects with citizens; 2) It lets citizens report service faults (e.g., broken pipes, potholes) to the right authorities. 1. For public project tracking, TransGov shows key data on local infrastructure projects, including completion dates, funding, contractor details, and status, using both crowdsourced and official data. It also feeds this data to Ghana's national open data portal.\n\n2. For complaints, users can submit them with media on TransGov via web or app. These are sent to the relevant department, which acts on them and updates the complainant upon resolution. Complaints are tagged for department-specific viewing on dashboards.\n\n    Chapter (Content) TransGov: Enhancing Government Responsiveness and Citizen Engagement in Ghana\n    TransGov tackles apathy and slow government responses, gauging success by resolved issues and response times. It links citizens with relevant departments, enhancing interaction but not complaint resolution speed, which it's improving by sharing complaints on social media, cutting resolution times by 60%. Now, potholes and burst pipes are fixed in 3 days and 48 hours respectively, faster than pre-TransGov times. Launched in 2014 to enable Ghanaians to monitor local projects and report issues, its creators aimed to clarify accountability for infrastructure and services. With 600,000 users, feedback is via web, app, SMS, or phone, managed by a 6-person team.\n\nGhana lacks mechanisms for citizens to access local project details. Despite being in the Open Government Partnership and having a data portal, only 15 of 133 datasets are available, showing limited progress in data accessibility. The absence of a right to information bill complicates obtaining information from government officials.\n\nThis results in confusion over project responsibility and difficulty in contacting relevant officials, increasing citizen apathy towards the government.\n\nTransGov tracks public project progress and serves as a platform for reporting service delivery faults, directing complaints to the right authority. It combines crowdsourced and official data to provide project snapshots and shares this with Ghana's data portal. Complaints are posted by users, forwarded to departments, and resolved status is confirmed with complainants. Identifying supportive government individuals and informing citizens about TransGov were initial challenges, tackled through strategic partnerships and engagement strategies like Facebook ads and townhall meetings.\n\nDocument: Innovative solutions for Zika and mosquito-borne diseases\nURL: https://thegovlab.org/static/files/publications/smarter-crowdsouring-for-zika-and-other-mosquito-borne-diseases.pdf\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Innovative Strategies to Combat Mosquito-Borne Diseases\n  The text provides an extensive overview of innovative strategies and recommendations for governments to combat mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) like Zika, focusing on public engagement, technology use, and partnerships. It discusses the importance of behavior change and communication in public health crises, outlines the use of serious games, celebrity PSAs, data visualizations, prize-backed challenges, and a 'What Works' clearinghouse to improve public awareness and action against MBDs. Additionally, it explores the use of crowdsourcing, drones, public-private partnerships, and adapted vehicles for efficient trash collection and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. The text also highlights the role of international cooperation and the potential of mobile micro-incentives to encourage individual behavior change.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Strategies for Combating Mosquito-Borne Diseases\n    To combat Zika and other MBDs, governments should motivate citizens to alter risky behaviors related to mosquito breeding and biting. Achieving this behavior change poses a significant public health challenge. This memo suggests three strategies for governments to enhance communication about MBDs and encourage necessary behavior changes, aligning with partner governments' priorities: 1) Initiate prize-backed challenges to foster engagement and innovation in Zika control at community and individual levels, 2) Gather and share peer-reviewed Zika/MBD communication best practices in an accessible format for policymakers, 3) Investigate \"serious games\" as a tool for awareness and behavior modification by organizing hackathons or collaborating with game designers for effective deployment.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Improving Communication Strategies in Public Health Crises: Lessons from Zika\n    New communication strategies for Zika are essential because current ones often fail by not clearly defining necessary behavior changes and their importance, not effectively handling uncertainty, and not creating enough urgency to change habits. Public health messages must detail how to stop the disease's spread and motivate immediate action by making the benefits of change clear.\n\nContinuous, evolving messaging is crucial for lasting behavior change, guiding people from awareness to action maintenance. Many programs falter in ensuring long-term behavior change. Future Zika communications must address these gaps with effective tools, as highlighted in this memo.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Communication Strategies for Public Health Crises\n    Governments explore new communication methods for public health crises, leveraging social media to target younger audiences and tailor messages. Online conference suggestions included:\n\nSerious Games: Utilize games and apps for disease awareness and data collection among youth.\n\nCelebrity PSA: Engage popular YouTubers to reach young, urban populations, complementing traditional celebrity efforts.\n\nData Visualizations: Employ visual aids for clearer message comprehension.\n\nPrize Challenges: Motivate behavior change with rewards.\n\nWhat Works Learning: Compile effective strategies in a case study repository.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Leveraging Prize-Backed Challenges for Zika and MBD Control\n    Governments can promote Zika control through prize-backed challenges, encouraging community and individual innovation. These challenges, increasingly used by governments and philanthropists, drive rapid innovation by rewarding results, not effort, and attract private investment in new markets.\n\nGovernments can implement three prize-backed challenge options for Zika and MBD behavior change. They need to follow key steps, including planning, prize design, and implementation, with resources from organizations like NESTA, the White House, and GovLab providing guidance and connections to past organizers for advice.\n\nSetting up a prize involves planning goals, defining problems, consulting experts, and deciding on incentives and audience. Prize design requires identifying stakeholders, setting evaluation criteria, and determining prize value and rules. Implementation covers choosing a platform, funding, engaging audiences, and evaluating impact, with resource needs varying by design.\n\nTo combat MBDs, governments can create a municipal \"seal of excellence\" prize for community mobilization, partner with telecoms for \"mobile micro-incentives\" for individual behavior change, and establish a technology innovation prize for new communication tools. Each option has its advantages, like engaging stakeholders and rapid deployment, but also faces challenges like monitoring progress and ensuring effective partnerships.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Establishing a What Works Clearinghouse for Zika and MBD Interventions\n    The text discusses the concept of establishing a What Works Clearinghouse for Zika and other Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) at both national and international levels. It outlines the challenges policymakers face in identifying effective interventions for MBD prevention due to the rapidly evolving and often inaccessible academic literature. The proposed clearinghouse aims to consolidate this literature, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and provide a centralized, searchable database for policymakers. The text details the functions of such a clearinghouse, the advantages and disadvantages of national versus international implementation, potential contributors, and a roadmap for setting up a clearinghouse. It emphasizes the importance of a broad stakeholder network in ensuring the clearinghouse's success and mentions specific organizations and initiatives that could contribute to or benefit from a clearinghouse.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Leveraging 'Serious' Games for Public Health Education\n    The text discusses the potential of 'serious' games as tools for public health education, specifically in raising awareness and changing behavior regarding health issues like Zika. It outlines various strategies for developing these games, including partnering with game designers, organizing hackathons, and modifying existing games. The text emphasizes the importance of targeting the right demographics, assessing knowledge gaps, and choosing the appropriate development model based on the target audience's access to technology. It also highlights successful case studies and suggests potential partners for developing serious games, including Games for Change, Playmob, and Socialab.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Combating Mosquito-Borne Diseases through Innovative Waste Management Strategies\n    The text outlines a comprehensive approach to combating mosquito-borne diseases like Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya by addressing the root causes of mosquito breeding sites through trash accumulation and standing water. It proposes a multi-faceted strategy involving community engagement, technological innovation, public-private partnerships, and adaptive waste collection methods. Key recommendations include involving communities in litter removal, using drones for waste identification, establishing partnerships with container manufacturers to reduce waste, and collecting trash in hard-to-reach areas with specialized vehicles. The text also discusses the importance of crowdsourcing for locating and removing waste, leveraging both online and offline methods, and the potential of drones in mapping hard-to-access areas for waste accumulation. Additionally, it emphasizes the role of public-private partnerships in waste management and the design of effective crowdsourcing projects for environmental conservation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Mobile App for Litter Mapping and Introduction to RTI International\n    Users snap and post litter photos on the app, tagging and mapping it for analysis. Geotags highlight hotspots, keywords track common brands, aiding in crafting sustainable solutions with companies. RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, focuses on enhancing human life through objective, multidisciplinary research. It combines scientific accuracy and technical skill to provide reliable data, in-depth analysis, and innovative solutions, supporting evidence-based public policy and practices. Tailoring its approach to each project, RTI offers global expertise with local dedication.\n\nDocument: In-depth exploration of virtual communities' impact, growth, and challenges\nURL: https://virtual-communities.thegovlab.org/files/DTR_report_en_EN.pdf\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Exploring the Potential of Online Groups to Build Genuine Communities\n  This comprehensive report explores the evolving concept of community in the digital age, examining whether online groups can foster genuine human connections akin to traditional, physical communities. It delves into various perspectives on the matter, including criticisms from social psychologists like Sherry Turkle, who argue that online interactions are superficial, and insights from political analysts like Yuval Levin, who suggests the internet reflects broader societal shifts towards shallow connections. However, the report also highlights optimistic views from experts like Rachel Happe and Marshall Ganz, who believe online groups can create meaningful communities through shared purposes and sound interaction practices.

These rules prohibit criticizing women's hijab styles, bullying, extremism, re-posts, off-topic content, and sharing posts externally to ensure privacy. Rostom personally vets moderator candidates to exclude religious extremists and confirm their genuine commitment to the pro-hijab community that supports religious identity and social integration.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Surviving Hijab: A Forum for Support and Discussion\n  Surviving Hijab is a support forum where women seek advice on wearing the hijab or facing challenges with it. A recent post by a woman contemplating removing her hijab, featuring veiled and unveiled photos, garnered over 13,000 likes and 3,000 comments in hours, with mixed opinions on her decision. Fashion, particularly \u201cFashion\u201d and \u201cStyling\u201d tags, dominates the forum, with members sharing outfit photos for feedback, often asking, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Currently, a challenge involves members emulating princess outfits with headscarves, highlighting hijab versatility and fun.\n\nWomen also seek modesty tips, like wrist coverings. The community celebrates personal milestones, including birthdays, engagements, weddings, and hijab anniversaries.\n\nDocument: Support network for African mothers in Germany with over 4,100 members\nURL: https://virtual-communities.thegovlab.org/case/african-mums-in-deutschland\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Empowering African Mothers in Germany: The Role of African Mums in Deutschland\n  The text outlines the purpose, activities, and impact of African Mums in Deutschland (AMD), a support group for African mothers in Germany. It highlights the group's focus on providing a network of support, sharing resources related to work, school, and promoting self-love, self-care, and healing among women of African descent. The group, governed by moderators with diverse skills, addresses issues like racism, domestic violence, and immigration. It fosters a supportive community through events, discussions, and personal meet-ups, and actively assists members in abusive situations or those needing language support.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Support and Empowerment Among African Mothers in Germany\n    African Mums in Deutschland provides a support network for sharing resources on work, school, and promoting self-love, self-care, and healing among African-descent women in Germany. Despite limited political representation in the German Bundestag, with only one of 709 seats held by an African-descent individual, Amoo and seven moderators, specifically designed to support African mothers, lead the group. This includes a multilingual psychologist enhancing communication, and a single mother empathizing with and supporting single mothers by sharing information and anticipating their needs. Amoo also runs a WhatsApp group specifically for Hamburg members to foster local connections and advice sharing.\n\nAmoo selects moderators through a detailed questionnaire assessing leadership, empathy, activity within the group, and maturity, focusing on addressing racism, domestic violence, and immigration issues. New moderators sign a contract to adhere to the group's rules, protect privacy, and maintain a kindness-first approach to moderation, with Amoo emphasizing, \u201cThe truth, no matter how it is, can be dressed up kindly,\u201d advocating for a gentle truth delivery.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Empowering African Mums in Deutschland Through Community Events\n    African Mums in Deutschland hosts online Q&As, presentations, and expert interviews on politics, career, education, relationships, and personal development, creating a supportive community. Events cater to members' interests and experiences, like a Cologne city council candidate discussing voter eligibility in August 2020, and a doctor addressing African women's health concerns in Germany in June.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Support Group AMD Aids Vulnerable Women\n    The group connects new friends and aids those in serious trouble, especially vulnerable women like undocumented or non-German speakers. Amoo highlights the assistance to women in abusive relationships, unsure of their next steps. In one instance, AMD members helped a woman document her abuse, enabling her separation from the abuser. Another woman was guided to a charity and a women's shelter for escape. Amoo takes pride in rescuing people from abuse.\n\nDocument: Exploration of collective intelligence in public problem-solving\nURL: https://directus.thegovlab.com/uploads/ci_cases/originals/b3b84db2-296c-435d-968a-8d066c6a7b87.pdf\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Collective Intelligence and Citizen Engagement: Successes, Processes, and Lessons Learned\n  This comprehensive analysis covers various examples of collective intelligence and citizen engagement initiatives from around the world, including the use of technology and sortition in lawmaking and public problem-solving. It highlights successful projects like vTaiwan, Ushahidi, and legislative citizen assemblies in Belgium, detailing their processes, impacts, and the lessons learned. The analysis also addresses the challenges and risks associated with these initiatives, offering insights into what makes some projects succeed while others fail.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Citizen Engagement and Collaborative Solutions for Societal Challenges\n    This comprehensive text explores various initiatives and projects aimed at addressing societal challenges through citizen engagement, open innovation, and collaborative efforts across different sectors and countries. It covers topics such as urban challenges and solutions in Monterrey, Mexico, and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, the use of collective intelligence in tackling urban issues, the implementation of the Carbon-Neutral Helsinki 2035 Action Plan, the Bridging the Word Gap Challenge in the United States, and the Citizens\u2019 Initiative law in Finland. The text also discusses the importance of high-level support, focused problem areas, early engagement with participants, combining methods for problem-solving, and lessons learned from these initiatives for future projects.\n\n      Chapter (Summary) The Citizens' Initiative Law in Finland: Empowering Direct Democracy\n      This text provides a comprehensive overview of the Citizens' Initiative law in Finland, a direct democracy tool that allows Finnish citizens to propose new legislation or changes to existing laws. It details the history, implementation, and impact of the law, including the role of technology and online platforms in facilitating citizen participation. The text also discusses the outcomes of various initiatives, the challenges faced in increasing political trust through such initiatives, and the lessons learned from the process. Additionally, it briefly compares Finland's experience with Estonia's citizens' initiative platform, highlighting the broader context of direct democracy efforts in the region.\n\n        Chapter (Content) The Evolution of the Citizens\u2019 Initiative in Finland\n        For its first five years, Open Ministry was key in drafting and gathering signatures for the Citizens\u2019 Initiative, using online tools for crowdsourcing and editing, and promoting through civil society networks before launching signature campaigns on avoinministerio.fi. After running out of funds, the government's kansalaisaloite.fi became the sole platform for initiative signatures.\n\nLaunched by the Ministry of Justice in late 2012, kansalaisaloite.fi lets citizens create and sign proposals using bank IDs, mobile certificates, or e-IDs, requiring a proposal title, description, justification, and contact info, with a minimum of five co-signers to post.\n\nKansalaisaloite.fi, managed part-time by a small team from the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Register Centre, resembles international online democracy projects like Decide Madrid and We the People.\n\n        Chapter (Content) The Impact of Finland's Citizens' Initiative on Democracy and Political Trust\n        Participation in citizens' initiatives varies, with the first to ban fur farming, initiated by Open Ministry, gathering over 70,000 signatures but was rejected by parliament in 2013, drawing attention to the Citizens\u2019 Initiative process. From March 2012 to August 2015, nearly 350 proposals were initiated, amassing over 1.3 million signatures, mainly through kansalaisaloite.fi, attracting about 200,000 monthly visitors. Roughly one-third of eligible voters, notably the youth, signed at least one proposal.\n\nSome proposals stood out, with only 10 of the first 350 exceeding 50,000 signatures, 93% received fewer than 10,000, and 45% under 100.\n\nSince 2012, over 1,000 initiatives were launched, 37 reaching 50,000 signatures. Parliament enacted only the same-sex marriage law, rejecting or still considering the other 36. Initiated in 2013, the same-sex marriage proposal, one of the most popular, gathered over 50,000 signatures in the first few hours and over 160,000 in six months. The Tahdon2013 campaign, supported by Open Ministry, Amnesty International, the European Union Youth in Action programme, and others, was launched on the Ministry of Justice\u2019s website in March 2013, presented to the Speaker of the Parliament in December 2013, and developed through co-editing workshops mainly with law students and proofread by volunteer law professors.\n\nThe Tahdon2013 campaign led to the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2017 after parliamentary approval in November 2014, the president's signature the following year, and enactment in 2017. The impact of the Citizens\u2019 Initiative on democratic trust is nuanced, with a survey among avoinministerio.fi and kansalaisaloite.fi visitors by a researcher at \u00c5bo Akademi University showing a minor decline in political trust among those who signed any initiative, except for those who signed the successful same-sex marriage initiative, indicating trust is linked to legislative outcomes. The Finnish National Election Studies found that the belief in the initiative's positive effect on Finnish democracy dropped from 83% to 76% between 2015 and 2019.",

It discusses the importance of behavior change and communication in public health crises, outlines the use of serious games, celebrity PSAs, data visualizations, prize-backed challenges, and a 'What Works' clearinghouse to improve public awareness and action against MBDs. Additionally, it explores the use of crowdsourcing, drones, public-private partnerships, and adapted vehicles for efficient trash collection and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. The text also highlights the role of international cooperation and the potential of mobile micro-incentives to encourage individual behavior change.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Strategies for Combating Mosquito-Borne Diseases\n    To combat Zika and other MBDs, governments should motivate citizens to alter risky behaviors related to mosquito breeding and biting. Achieving this behavior change poses a significant public health challenge. This memo suggests three strategies for governments to enhance communication about MBDs and encourage necessary behavior changes, aligning with partner governments' priorities: 1) Initiate prize-backed challenges to foster engagement and innovation in Zika control at community and individual levels, 2) Gather and share peer-reviewed Zika/MBD communication best practices in an accessible format for policymakers, 3) Investigate \"serious games\" as a tool for awareness and behavior modification by organizing hackathons or collaborating with game designers for effective deployment.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Improving Communication Strategies in Public Health Crises: Lessons from Zika\n    New communication strategies for Zika are essential because current ones often fail by not clearly defining necessary behavior changes and their importance, not effectively handling uncertainty, and not creating enough urgency to change habits. Public health messages must detail how to stop the disease's spread and motivate immediate action by making the benefits of change clear.\n\nContinuous, evolving messaging is crucial for lasting behavior change, guiding people from awareness to action maintenance. Many programs falter in ensuring long-term behavior change. Future Zika communications must address these gaps with effective tools, as highlighted in this memo.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Communication Strategies for Public Health Crises\n    Governments explore new communication methods for public health crises, leveraging social media to target younger audiences and tailor messages. Online conference suggestions included:\n\nSerious Games: Utilize games and apps for disease awareness and data collection among youth.\n\nCelebrity PSA: Engage popular YouTubers to reach young, urban populations, complementing traditional celebrity efforts.\n\nData Visualizations: Employ visual aids for clearer message comprehension.\n\nPrize Challenges: Motivate behavior change with rewards.\n\nWhat Works Learning: Compile effective strategies in a case study repository.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Leveraging Prize-Backed Challenges for Zika and MBD Control\n    Governments can promote Zika control through prize-backed challenges, encouraging community and individual innovation. These challenges, increasingly used by governments and philanthropists, drive rapid innovation by rewarding results, not effort, and attract private investment in new markets.\n\nGovernments can implement three prize-backed challenge options for Zika and MBD behavior change. They need to follow key steps, including planning, prize design, and implementation, with resources from organizations like NESTA, the White House, and GovLab providing guidance and connections to past organizers for advice.\n\nSetting up a prize involves planning goals, defining problems, consulting experts, and deciding on incentives and audience. Prize design requires identifying stakeholders, setting evaluation criteria, and determining prize value and rules. Implementation covers choosing a platform, funding, engaging audiences, and evaluating impact, with resource needs varying by design.\n\nTo combat MBDs, governments can create a municipal \"seal of excellence\" prize for community mobilization, partner with telecoms for \"mobile micro-incentives\" for individual behavior change, and establish a technology innovation prize for new communication tools. Each option has its advantages, like engaging stakeholders and rapid deployment, but also faces challenges like monitoring progress and ensuring effective partnerships.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Establishing a What Works Clearinghouse for Zika and MBD Interventions\n    The text discusses the concept of establishing a What Works Clearinghouse for Zika and other Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) at both national and international levels. It outlines the challenges policymakers face in identifying effective interventions for MBD prevention due to the rapidly evolving and often inaccessible academic literature. The proposed clearinghouse aims to consolidate this literature, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and provide a centralized, searchable database for policymakers. The text details the functions of such a clearinghouse, the advantages and disadvantages of national versus international implementation, potential contributors, and a roadmap for setting up a clearinghouse. It emphasizes the importance of a broad stakeholder network in ensuring the clearinghouse's success and mentions specific organizations and initiatives that could contribute to or benefit from a clearinghouse.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Leveraging 'Serious' Games for Public Health Education\n    The text discusses the potential of 'serious' games as tools for public health education, specifically in raising awareness and changing behavior regarding health issues like Zika. It outlines various strategies for developing these games, including partnering with game designers, organizing hackathons, and modifying existing games. The text emphasizes the importance of targeting the right demographics, assessing knowledge gaps, and choosing the appropriate development model based on the target audience's access to technology. It also highlights successful case studies and suggests potential partners for developing serious games, including Games for Change, Playmob, and Socialab.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Combating Mosquito-Borne Diseases through Innovative Waste Management Strategies\n    The text outlines a comprehensive approach to combating mosquito-borne diseases like Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya by addressing the root causes of mosquito breeding sites through trash accumulation and standing water. It proposes a multi-faceted strategy involving community engagement, technological innovation, public-private partnerships, and adaptive waste collection methods. Key recommendations include involving communities in litter removal, using drones for waste identification, establishing partnerships with container manufacturers to reduce waste, and collecting trash in hard-to-reach areas with specialized vehicles. The text also discusses the importance of crowdsourcing for locating and removing waste, leveraging both online and offline methods, and the potential of drones in mapping hard-to-access areas for waste accumulation. Additionally, it emphasizes the role of public-private partnerships in waste management and the design of effective crowdsourcing projects for environmental conservation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Mobile App for Litter Mapping and Introduction to RTI International\n    Users snap and post litter photos on the app, tagging and mapping it for analysis.

Dehumanizing opponents erodes public trust in the democratic system, creating an \"us versus them\" mentality. The dangers of such rhetoric are real and present in the United States.\n\nBy leveraging AI and unlocking global expertise, we're developing innovative strategies against election-related violence and subversion to reinforce democracy.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Leveraging Generative AI and Civic Tech to Address Election Subversion\n  To address complex challenges like election subversion, which includes issues from media-fueled doubt about election integrity to violence against officials and technology vulnerabilities, it's essential to break them down into smaller, manageable problems. This process requires weeks of research and interviews, followed by months or years of due diligence to assess what solutions have been tried, their effectiveness, and their potential applicability elsewhere.\n\nGenerative AI, specifically large-language model technology, is revolutionizing our collective problem-solving capabilities by excelling at organizing and summarizing vast amounts of data, not just generating it.\n\nTo accelerate problem identification and solution development for election subversion, we enlisted the Icelandic civic tech entrepreneur, Bjarnason, who has developed tools used in over 10,000 citizen engagements globally since 2008. From his cabin alongside the desolate and beautiful White River in Southern Iceland, Bjarnason acknowledges with cheery bluntness that despite citizen participation, governments often struggle to utilize the feedback effectively.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Enhancing Policymaking with AI: The Case of Policy Synth\n  The text discusses the development and application of 'Policy Synth,' a tool that leverages GPT-4, a multimodal large language model by Open AI, to enhance the process of policymaking. It automates the generation of search queries to identify problems and their root causes, focusing on 'election subversion' as a case study. The tool breaks down complex issues into smaller, more manageable challenges and uses AI to propose solutions. A notable feature is the use of a genetic algorithm to evolve recommendations, ensuring they are well-suited to address the identified problems. Additionally, Policy Synth employs Elo Scoring to rank solutions based on various criteria. The text highlights the benefits of combining AI with human expertise to accelerate the evaluation of evidence and decision-making processes, especially in contexts involving taxpayer money and public participation.\n\nDocument: AI in combating online hate and extremism\nURL: https://rebootdemocracy.ai/blog/AI-Content-Moderation\n\n  Chapter (Content) The Role of AI in Combating Online Hate and Extremism\n  In a year with rising online hate, dismantled safety teams, during a presidential election, AI's nuanced defense is vital against extremism and disinformation.\n\nForbes revealed Elon Musk, since leading X (formerly Twitter), fired over 80% of \"trust and safety\" engineers, a third of non-engineer staff, over 1,000 employees, and embarked on a crusade to reinstate banned accounts, fueling online abuse, per Australia\u2019s online safety commissioner.\n\nSince the pandemic, online hate and hate crimes surged, notably during election years. Post-2020 election, anti-Black crimes rose by 14%, anti-Hispanic/Latino by 35%, and anti-Asian by 168%.\n\nFacing the 2024 election's expected political extremism and increased online reliance due to the pandemic, the digital commons remain unsafe. With major social media platforms' backdrop, significant moderation workforce cuts, and a lack of online safety measures, combating digital hate and extremism is questioned.\n\nAI for content moderation could be the answer.\n\n  Chapter (Content) The Challenges of Traditional Content Moderation\n  Traditional content moderation uses human moderators to analyze and manage the vast majority of content that goes against a platform's community guidelines, including hate speech, disinformation, harassment, and other inappropriate behaviors. This process not only demands a vast drain of resources from the platform but also poses a separate, incredibly draining and difficult challenge for moderators.\n\n  Chapter (Content) The Evolution of Content Moderation: From Algorithms to AI\n  Social media platforms use algorithms and machine-learning to manage content, employing keyword filters, black lists, and pixel counting for nudity, despite their limitations in understanding language nuances.\n\nQuestion arises on the impact of prioritizing data-driven, deep learning for moderation.\n\nDeep learning AI, by analyzing patterns and nuances, can enhance content moderation, offering scalability and efficiency, especially against AI-generated threats and in live streams, where it can preemptively detect harmful content.\n\nHowever, due to the high costs of large language models (LLMs), platforms should instead develop specialized, cost-effective AI tools focused on moderating specific types of content, like Facebook's approach to addressing hate speech against minoritized groups.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Enhancing Content Moderation with AI: Balancing Bias Mitigation and Free Expression\n  Bias can't be fully removed but AI systems, learning through human feedback, can reduce it and quickly adapt, making moderation fairer and more effective over time.\n\nAI reliance on past data risks stifling free expression, hence the \"AI on tap, not on top\" strategy emphasizes human-led decision-making with AI for tasks, ensuring adaptability to new challenges through human feedback.\n\nAI in natural language processing is crucial for scaling content moderation, filtering hate speech and disinformation, protecting moderators, and adapting to new harms, especially before the 2024 elections.\n\nDocument: Weekly insights on AI's role in governance, democracy, and policy, featuring global examples and debates.\nURL: https://rebootdemocracy.ai/blog/News-That-Caught-Our-Eye-11\n\n  Chapter (Content) Audrey Tang Discusses AI and Governance at Northeastern University\n  Last Friday, Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, visited Northeastern to conclude \"AI in Action Week,\" discussing with Director Beth Simone Noveck.

It discusses the importance of behavior change and communication in public health crises, outlines the use of serious games, celebrity PSAs, data visualizations, prize-backed challenges, and a 'What Works' clearinghouse to improve public awareness and action against MBDs. Additionally, it explores the use of crowdsourcing, drones, public-private partnerships, and adapted vehicles for efficient trash collection and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. The text also highlights the role of international cooperation and the potential of mobile micro-incentives to encourage individual behavior change.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Strategies for Combating Mosquito-Borne Diseases\n    To combat Zika and other MBDs, governments should motivate citizens to alter risky behaviors related to mosquito breeding and biting. Achieving this behavior change poses a significant public health challenge. This memo suggests three strategies for governments to enhance communication about MBDs and encourage necessary behavior changes, aligning with partner governments' priorities: 1) Initiate prize-backed challenges to foster engagement and innovation in Zika control at community and individual levels, 2) Gather and share peer-reviewed Zika/MBD communication best practices in an accessible format for policymakers, 3) Investigate \"serious games\" as a tool for awareness and behavior modification by organizing hackathons or collaborating with game designers for effective deployment.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Improving Communication Strategies in Public Health Crises: Lessons from Zika\n    New communication strategies for Zika are essential because current ones often fail by not clearly defining necessary behavior changes and their importance, not effectively handling uncertainty, and not creating enough urgency to change habits. Public health messages must detail how to stop the disease's spread and motivate immediate action by making the benefits of change clear.\n\nContinuous, evolving messaging is crucial for lasting behavior change, guiding people from awareness to action maintenance. Many programs falter in ensuring long-term behavior change. Future Zika communications must address these gaps with effective tools, as highlighted in this memo.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Communication Strategies for Public Health Crises\n    Governments explore new communication methods for public health crises, leveraging social media to target younger audiences and tailor messages. Online conference suggestions included:\n\nSerious Games: Utilize games and apps for disease awareness and data collection among youth.\n\nCelebrity PSA: Engage popular YouTubers to reach young, urban populations, complementing traditional celebrity efforts.\n\nData Visualizations: Employ visual aids for clearer message comprehension.\n\nPrize Challenges: Motivate behavior change with rewards.\n\nWhat Works Learning: Compile effective strategies in a case study repository.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Leveraging Prize-Backed Challenges for Zika and MBD Control\n    Governments can promote Zika control through prize-backed challenges, encouraging community and individual innovation. These challenges, increasingly used by governments and philanthropists, drive rapid innovation by rewarding results, not effort, and attract private investment in new markets.\n\nGovernments can implement three prize-backed challenge options for Zika and MBD behavior change. They need to follow key steps, including planning, prize design, and implementation, with resources from organizations like NESTA, the White House, and GovLab providing guidance and connections to past organizers for advice.\n\nSetting up a prize involves planning goals, defining problems, consulting experts, and deciding on incentives and audience. Prize design requires identifying stakeholders, setting evaluation criteria, and determining prize value and rules. Implementation covers choosing a platform, funding, engaging audiences, and evaluating impact, with resource needs varying by design.\n\nTo combat MBDs, governments can create a municipal \"seal of excellence\" prize for community mobilization, partner with telecoms for \"mobile micro-incentives\" for individual behavior change, and establish a technology innovation prize for new communication tools. Each option has its advantages, like engaging stakeholders and rapid deployment, but also faces challenges like monitoring progress and ensuring effective partnerships.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Establishing a What Works Clearinghouse for Zika and MBD Interventions\n    The text discusses the concept of establishing a What Works Clearinghouse for Zika and other Mosquito-Borne Diseases (MBDs) at both national and international levels. It outlines the challenges policymakers face in identifying effective interventions for MBD prevention due to the rapidly evolving and often inaccessible academic literature. The proposed clearinghouse aims to consolidate this literature, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and provide a centralized, searchable database for policymakers. The text details the functions of such a clearinghouse, the advantages and disadvantages of national versus international implementation, potential contributors, and a roadmap for setting up a clearinghouse. It emphasizes the importance of a broad stakeholder network in ensuring the clearinghouse's success and mentions specific organizations and initiatives that could contribute to or benefit from a clearinghouse.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Leveraging 'Serious' Games for Public Health Education\n    The text discusses the potential of 'serious' games as tools for public health education, specifically in raising awareness and changing behavior regarding health issues like Zika. It outlines various strategies for developing these games, including partnering with game designers, organizing hackathons, and modifying existing games. The text emphasizes the importance of targeting the right demographics, assessing knowledge gaps, and choosing the appropriate development model based on the target audience's access to technology. It also highlights successful case studies and suggests potential partners for developing serious games, including Games for Change, Playmob, and Socialab.\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Combating Mosquito-Borne Diseases through Innovative Waste Management Strategies\n    The text outlines a comprehensive approach to combating mosquito-borne diseases like Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya by addressing the root causes of mosquito breeding sites through trash accumulation and standing water. It proposes a multi-faceted strategy involving community engagement, technological innovation, public-private partnerships, and adaptive waste collection methods. Key recommendations include involving communities in litter removal, using drones for waste identification, establishing partnerships with container manufacturers to reduce waste, and collecting trash in hard-to-reach areas with specialized vehicles. The text also discusses the importance of crowdsourcing for locating and removing waste, leveraging both online and offline methods, and the potential of drones in mapping hard-to-access areas for waste accumulation. Additionally, it emphasizes the role of public-private partnerships in waste management and the design of effective crowdsourcing projects for environmental conservation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Mobile App for Litter Mapping and Introduction to RTI International\n    Users snap and post litter photos on the app, tagging and mapping it for analysis.

Merely having a skills directory isn't enough to tackle global poverty challenges. Alone, tools achieve little. However, effectively using SkillFinder to match skills with problems could significantly impact the Bank's mission. Instead of assuming its effectiveness, SkillFinder offers a chance to empirically test whether accessible data on people's skills enhances project assignments and fosters more innovative solutions.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Enhancing Organizational Efficiency through an Expertise Locator\n  An expertise locator enhances organizational memory by quickly accessing human capital and highlighting skill gaps for agile analysis, guiding urgent learning needs. It hypothesizes that matching skills to challenges expands leadership networks with innovative problem solvers. Testing can confirm if this increases the Bank's responsiveness, coverage, and innovation through three experiments.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Exploring Team Formation with SkillFinder at the World Bank\n  First, the World Bank leadership could use SkillFinder to assess assembling diverse teams for a development challenge, including junior and unfamiliar members. An A/B test, though not perfectly scientific, could compare these new teams against existing ones, yielding insights into expertise-based team formation's value.\n\nSecond, SkillFinder allows testing if experience trumps credentials in team effectiveness by forming teams based on each criterion for direct comparison. This experiment explores the dynamics between practical experience and formal education in achieving better outcomes.\n\nFinally, it's debatable whether passion surpasses credentials and experience in team assignments, a hypothesis worth testing. The Bank could promote an internal prize-backed challenge aimed at reducing poverty by a specific measure, encouraging participation and observing results from teams formed on varying criteria.",

This method, unclear in its outcome, seeks the best solution by engaging the public. The challenge is among over a thousand hosted by a U.S. agency online, part of a broader effort since 2010 by over 100 federal agencies to use 'open innovation' challenges to source solutions from the public for complex issues.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Bridging the Word Gap Challenge: MCHB's Initiative to Support Early Childhood Development\n  The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), within the Health Resources and Services Administration focused on enhancing healthcare for isolated, economically, or medically vulnerable groups, initiated the Bridging the Word Gap Challenge. This challenge aimed to mitigate the word exposure disparity between children from low and high-income families by promoting talking, reading, and singing by parents and caregivers. Developed with federal partners and stakeholders, it sought innovative solutions, engaging a wide range of innovators.\n\nA 1992 study highlighted a 30 million word gap by age three between children from varying income levels, placing low-income children at an educational disadvantage. The MCHB's challenge, offering $300,000 in prizes, aimed for low-cost, scalable, tech-based interventions to boost parent-child interactions (ages 0\u20134) and drew diverse participants like startups and academics. Launched in September 2015, detailed in the Federal Register with timelines, rules, and judging criteria, the year-and-a-half challenge involved a four-phase process. A panel of four federal employees from relevant agencies judged entries based on criteria including accessibility, impact, sustainability, and implementation, providing specific questions on sustainability (e.g., integration into daily life, enjoyment) and impact (behavior change theory).\n\nInitially, the MCHB sought wide participation, asking for proposals with descriptions, evidence, implementation methods, and execution capability. Both traditional and social media were utilized to attract participants, with $10,000 awarded to ten selected ideas.\n\nIn the next phase, nine participants (one withdrew) had six months to prototype and refine their ideas, culminating in a live Demo Day presentation.

Her 'why' came in 1999, when she was 19. On the way to a summer vacation at the Red Sea, the bus Rostom and her family were riding on blew a tire and crashed. Feeling blessed by God after a bus crash where she was unharmed, she decided to put on the hijab and has worn it ever since. Her cousin, with whom Rostom had switched seats only a few minutes earlier, was paralyzed and died a few months later. In 2014, Rostom created Surviving Hijab as a community for women who wear the hijab to support one another through personal, political, and societal struggles. An additional goal was to bring visibility to Muslim women facing discrimination in both the Muslim and non-Muslim world. The rules of some sports leagues, for instance, do not allow athletes to wear the hijab during competition, forcing them to choose between their faith and sport. Rostom asserts, \"We all have a voice - we just need to feel empowered to use it,\" championing empowerment and visibility.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Surviving Hijab: Empowering Hijabi Women Online\n  By October 2020, Surviving Hijab reached over 900,000 members, gaining 30,000 in a month. It's a private group open to women interested in hijab culture, excluding men. Members join for connection and understanding of hijabi women's challenges, finding belonging and safety in sharing experiences.\n\nSurviving Hijab actively shares diverse content online and mobilizes against discrimination, like the #NoBurkiniBans campaign, leading to policy reversals at some resorts. They also host real-life events, offering discussions and beauty tips.\n\nThe group faces internal conflicts, especially over dress code interpretations, leading to strict moderation to maintain harmony. Disagreements often escalate quickly, prompting the removal of those breaking rules or supporting such breaches.\n\nCritiques arise over the group's fashion focus, with some members seeking more empowerment in various life aspects. The group contends with internal and external criticism, causing some members to leave due to the negativity or personal impact of harsh comments.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Understanding the Term 'Hijab': A Case Study\n  \"Hijab\" refers to a Muslim women's dress code and the headscarf for compliance, used interchangeably in this case study.

AI can revolutionize government-public interaction through its ability to process and simplify large data sets, making government information, often hidden in complex websites and PDFs, more accessible.\n\nPublic knowledge is vast but fragmented, with scientific publications and web communication increasing, ironically making mutual understanding harder. A decade ago, 1.8 million scientific articles were published annually, a number that has grown, while the web has both facilitated and complicated communication.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s 2008 transition team's call for public ideas, receiving 125,000 people's 44,000 suggestions, highlighted the difficulty of managing excessive input, embodying the \"dog chases ambulance\" adage.\n\nAI can enhance service delivery, support public workers, improve data use, boost engagement, and increase problem-solving by making public and institutional voices clearer. The following sections briefly discuss AI's potential to improve customer experience in government.\n\n1. MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE INTELLIGIBLE: CREATING CONVERSATIONAL GOVERNMENT\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Enhancing Public Engagement and Problem Solving with AI\n    The text discusses the overwhelming amount of information and misinformation on the web, particularly in the context of public comments on federal regulations, using the 2017 Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality comments as an example. It introduces AI as a solution to effectively manage and analyze public input, highlighting various AI tools and platforms like de-duplication software, Citizen Lab, Your Priorities, Cortico, ChatGPT, Anthropic, and UrbanistAI that facilitate public engagement, policy making, and citizen collaboration. The text also covers the use of AI in addressing complex problems like election subversion, showcasing the Policy Synth toolkit for smarter crowdsourcing and policy making. It emphasizes AI's potential in enhancing public consultations, solving complex problems, and fostering a new era of citizen collaboration.\n\n      Chapter (Content) The Challenge of Public Comments in the Digital Age\n      The Web and social media has often left us drowning in too much information and misinformation, making it hard for agencies and the public to discern genuine dialogue. The 1946 Administrative Procedure Act granted Americans the right to comment on pending federal regulations. In 2017, the FCC issued a draft regulation on Internet neutrality seeking to overturn an Obama-era rule, receiving 22 million comments. Only 6% were unique; 94% were duplicates, some submitted hundreds of thousands of times, many under false names, including 7 million from one account. Even with \"only\" 1.32 million non-duplicates, that number is too many for the public or policymakers to read.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Enhancing Public Engagement with AI Tools\n      AI tools not only make public input more manageable but also help both the public and institutions understand it, fostering broad participation and oversight in agency AI use. Generative AI aids in removing duplicates and extracting unique comments for crafting regulations. Citizen Lab's AI, utilized by over 500 governments, clusters, groups, and organizes public comments for better engagement. Hamburg's DIPAS uses natural language processing for city planning feedback, capable of processing Plattdeutsch dialect, local acronyms, and planning jargon.\n\nYour Priorities, a free, open-source tool by Citizens Foundation, used globally in thousands of engagements, employs AI to scan for toxicity and automate moderation, reducing costs. It identifies speech violating terms and norms, bringing it to moderators' attention. Leveraging ChatGPT, it summarizes key ideas, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements, enhancing discussions and policy development.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Leveraging Machine Learning for Community Engagement and Language Assistance\n      At MIT, the Cortico project uses machine learning to synthesize comments in live, face-to-face discussions. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, small groups of citizens participated in community conversations about the city\u2019s police, which had come under scrutiny for violence against Black residents. The conversations were recorded using Cortico. The machine learning tool highlighted topics of common concern and these became the basis for interview questions for the four finalists for the chief of police job.\n\nFor those who struggle with language barriers, tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic can translate poorly worded ideas into well-crafted contributions. Those not fluent in the dominant language or who are simply not good writers can turn a vague idea into clear, clean prose. Prompt one of these free genAI tools to write a fifty-word proposal for a plastic bag tax and the machine returns: \u201cTo combat plastic pollution, we propose implementing a bag tax. Data shows that after Ireland introduced a \u20ac0.15 tax in 2002, plastic bag usage dropped ninety percent within a year, significantly reducing litter and promoting reusable bags. This tax would encourage sustainable behavior, cut landfill waste, and generate revenue for environmental projects.\u201d\n\n\n      Chapter (Content) AI in Urban Planning: Fostering Citizen Engagement and Visualizing Future Cities\n      UrbanistAI, a Finnish-Italian initiative, enables citizen engagement by transforming public urban design ideas into hyper-realistic images, including specific changes like adding planters or converting roads into pedestrian zones in Helsinki.

This move highlights technology's critical role in governance, emphasizing CAIOs' need to innovate public engagement through AI, ensuring inclusivity in policymaking, and stressing that their role should be explicitly linked to this task. It suggests that OMB's guidance must evolve to mandate agencies to use AI for analyzing public sentiment and improving engagement, leveraging AI's potential to enhance public consultations.\n\n  Chapter (Content) The Need for AI in Enhancing Public Participation in OMB's Decision-Making\n  The guidance suggests consulting affected groups through outdated methods like user testing, soliciting comments via the Federal Register, customer feedback, and meetings like listening sessions, without instructing the use of AI to improve consultation efficiency and equity.\n\nHighlighting a missed opportunity, the OMB's \"coming soon\" link for comments shows a lack of leveraging new technology for democratic decision-making.\n\nTraditional public participation methods, limited by scale, speed, and accessibility, could be enhanced by AI for real-time analysis and broader inclusivity. The guidance should mandate the CAIO to regularly engage with the public using AI, making consultations more effective and equitable.\n\n  Chapter (Content) AI Tools for Public Engagement and Moderation\n  Over 500 governments use Citizen Lab's AI platform for analyzing large text volumes, automating summaries, topic classification, and categorization for easier access.\n\nYour Priorities, a free tool by Citizens Foundation, uses AI to detect toxic posts, enforce community standards, and provide a chatbot for queries on specific topics or comments.\n\nMIT's Deb Roy and his team apply machine learning to synthesize live discussion comments, enabling rapid understanding and insight extraction from spoken conversations, even in low literacy communities.\n\nFacebook's open source AI tools translate text into 100 languages and speech into 35, facilitating inclusive participation for non-native English speakers.\n\nDocument: Insightful exploration of AI's impact on urban planning and participatory design, featuring expert discussions.\nURL: https://content.thegovlab.com/items/reboot_democracy_resources/1867?fields=*.*,event_series.general_events_series_id.*\n\n  Chapter (Content) The Evolution of Urban Planning: From Social Visions to Market-Driven Projects\n  Grateful to speak, despite it being past midnight in Finland, on Urbanista's origin in 2019, sparked as the pandemic halted urban projects, leading to a reevaluation of city visions towards human-centric planning. This shift introduced new buzzwords, redefining our work with municipalities and ministries on city design.\n\nHistorical urban visions like Howard's Garden City and Wright's Broadacre City, not always fully realized, influenced global urban planning with their social roots, contrasting with today's market-driven visions that often neglect local needs. This transition from socially rooted to financially motivated visions risks ignoring genuine community demands, with many projects failing due to lack of financial or public support.\n\nThe Toronto waterfront project by Google exemplifies such failures, where its marketability ignored critical needs like affordable housing. Sidewalk Labs' controversial proposal to use Toronto's property taxes for the project raised privacy and taxpayer money concerns, misaligning with community priorities. Similarly, Saudi Arabia's Neom project, despite scaling back ambitions, reflects urban visions serving political interests over community needs, highlighting a trend of visions being used for political display rather than fulfilling community demands.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Reimagining Participatory Planning with AI and Collective Intelligence\n  We transformed participatory planning, making stakeholders active creators to address public demands for collaborative processes and correct the media representation imbalance between professionals and citizens.\n\nWe leveraged imagery in participatory planning, enabling all to co-design future visions with AI. We adopted collective intelligence, as defined by Geoff Mulgan, to foster inclusive design and dialogue.\n\nIn 2020, our Narva project illustrated this approach, with citizens using images to discuss and design futures, culminating in a designer sketching these visions. This initiative, before AI, led to a collective vision now incorporated into Narva's master plan, demonstrating the effectiveness of a shared language in enabling change.\n\nOur first AI-assisted project was the High Street redesign in a northern city in Finland, merging citizens' insights with technical expertise, illustrating AI's role in participatory planning.\n\nIn 2021, the challenge extended beyond AI's negative image to convincing entities of the value of in-person participation over online forms, despite AI's daunting perception.\n\nBy 2023, familiarity with technologies like GPT improved AI's image, prompting us to expand our work with cities and ministries. Participants, initially proposing basic improvements, used AI to develop complex solutions. They evaluated these ideas in real settings, incorporating blindfolds for unique assessments, and digitally, showcasing human-AI collaboration. This led to a final vote and debate on preferred visions. The mayor of Pristina's future communications about citizen-designed spaces, initiating their development, exemplifies the impact of our participatory planning approach.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Innovative Participatory Urban Planning and Design Model\n  The text outlines a comprehensive approach to participatory urban planning and design, emphasizing the importance of in-person engagement for meaningful participation.

Clearly define organizational needs before starting predictive analytics, emphasizing the importance of data availability and organization for algorithm development. Governments should build data analytics platforms for Zika response, following a non-linear six-step data mining process outlined in CRISP-DM (Shearer, 2000).\n\n    Chapter (Content) Collaborative Efforts for a Zika-Related Data Portal\n    Governments should create a Zika data portal linked to a clearinghouse, facilitating open data sharing for improved modeling. Experts from the Smarter Crowdsourcing - Zika project advocate for more government data disclosure, emphasizing its benefits in preparing for epidemics and fostering a data market for companies utilizing big data technologies. The lack of a centralized data hub led to initiatives like BuzzFeed's Zika Data Guide and CDC's Zika Data Repository, with Michael Johansson providing technical advice to governments on similar endeavors. This portal would centralize crucial data for modeling, such as hospital and geographic details, directing users to existing data sources without hosting them, improving machine-readability and updates, aligning with WHO/PAHO's shared platform recommendations and their April 2016 searchable Zika research database launch.\n\nThe portal should be managed by a non-partisan, data-publishing organization with secure infrastructure, capable of monitoring data use and enhancing based on user feedback, possibly building on CDC's repository under PAHO. Mirroring the US and UK's 2014 health data collaboration for healthcare improvement, setting up the portal requires defining its scope, identifying data sources, establishing metadata standards, creating a searchable catalogue, outlining governance, assigning roles, and developing an engagement strategy with a feedback loop for ongoing improvement.\n\nPromoting open data via policies for government-funded research data sharing, as embraced by The Gates Foundation, NIH, and Wellcome Trust, boosts research. The Zika Open Data portal, integrated with a What Works clearinghouse for peer-reviewed Zika and MBD intervention literature, would benefit from governance, maintenance, and communication synergies. The CDC's GitHub repository, led by Johansson, showcases a low-resource, impactful model for centralized Zika data access, enabling researchers to automatically update data, highlighting the project's feasibility and its role in enhancing prediction models.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Global Health and Data Science Professionals: Roles and Challenges\n    The repository's data, sourced from national reports, faces interoperability issues due to non-uniform case definitions among countries.

        "actual_output": "Yuval Noah Harari is a prominent historian and author, known for his discussions on the broad impacts of technology and society. Here are some key insights about his views:\n\n- **Critique of Online Communities**: Harari has expressed skepticism about the depth of online communities. In his book \"The Fractured Republic: Renewing America\u2019s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism,\" he argues that while the internet facilitates the formation of groups around single interests, it does so at the cost of deeper, real-world community ties. He suggests that the ease of joining and leaving online groups undermines the building of true community.\n\n- **Reflection of Societal Shifts**: Harari believes that the internet mirrors broader societal shifts towards shallow connections. This perspective is critical in understanding his views on how modern technology reflects and influences contemporary social structures and individual behaviors.\n\n- **Broader Implications**: His work extends beyond just the critique of online interactions, touching on various aspects of how technology and historical trends shape societies. Harari's insights are valuable for understanding the complexities of modern social and political dynamics.\n\nHarari's perspectives provide a critical lens through which we can examine the evolution of community and connectivity in the digital age, highlighting the challenges and transformations faced by societies globally.undefined",

It delves into various perspectives on the matter, including criticisms from social psychologists like Sherry Turkle, who argue that online interactions are superficial, and insights from political analysts like Yuval Levin, who suggests the internet reflects broader societal shifts towards shallow connections. However, the report also highlights optimistic views from experts like Rachel Happe and Marshall Ganz, who believe online groups can create meaningful communities through shared purposes and sound interaction practices. The report presents case studies, such as the Female IN group, which supports women in the Nigerian diaspora, showcasing how online communities can offer emotional support, foster inclusivity, and even challenge cultural norms. It concludes by emphasizing the need for further research into online communities' impact and the emerging profession of online group leaders who play a crucial role in nurturing these digital spaces.\n\n    Chapter (Content) The Evolution of Community in the Digital Age\n    \"Community\" once meant deep connection to a place and its people, but its meaning is evolving. The worry that community is fading, losing the close social bonds that bring stability and meaning, is widespread in both rich and poorer nations. This report investigates if online groups can form new communities, possibly linked to physical locations but not confined by them.\n\n    Chapter (Content) The Debate on Online Groups vs. Physical Communities\n    Critics view online groups as subpar to physical communities. In her 2011 book \"Alone Together,\" Sherry Turkle criticizes online life for offering illusory connections, making us feel simultaneously engaged and isolated, missing out on real interaction benefits. She argues that digital ties preoccupy us without truly connecting, unlike the vulnerability and presence required in face-to-face conversations.\n\nQuestioning the depth of online communities, Yuval Levin, in his 2016 book \"The Fractured Republic: Renewing America\u2019s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism,\" argues the Internet, though not responsible for community decline, mirrors America's shift towards broad, yet shallow social networks. It facilitates forming groups around single interests at the cost of deeper, real-world community ties, highlighting the concern that the ease of joining and leaving online groups undermines true community building.\n\n    Chapter (Content) The Emotional Benefits and Preconditions of Successful Online Communities\n    Despite academic skepticism, interviews reveal online groups, notably on Facebook, provide real emotional support and help with personal struggles. Sociologist Eric Klinenberg posits true communities need a physical tie, exposure to diverse viewpoints, and opportunities for building relationships across political divides.\n\nOur study confirms Klinenberg's criteria in the strongest online communities, which are not wholly online, like Female IN aiding rural Nigerian women, and HumanKind Global mobilizing volunteers. These groups maintain real-world ties, emphasize face-to-face interactions, and foster exposure to diverse perspectives for genuine bonds and inclusive communities. From 50 interviews, diverse case studies, and a global survey, we found successful Facebook Groups host robust, deliberative, and often contentious discussions on important topics, requiring strong moderation and good governance for success. These groups empower leaders and members, crossing traditional boundaries of race, class, and more, enabling unique community formation and leadership online. They highlight the significance of geographical ties while allowing non-dominant groups to convene and govern themselves in virtual spaces, creating communities not possible in real space.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Empowering Women in the Diaspora: The Story of Female in Nigeria (FIN)\n    Lola Omolola, a Chicago-based mother of two, founded the Female in Nigeria Facebook Group in 2015 after growing up in Lagos, Nigeria. Designed as a safe space for women in the Nigerian diaspora, the group addresses relationship struggles, health issues, abuse, grief, and loss. Starting from Omolola's network and spreading by word of mouth, it grew into a 1.7 million-member community across over 100 countries. As a private Facebook Group, Female IN allows women to post experiences and receive support, sharing resources on coping with abuse, publicizing convicted abusers, and sharing survival stories. It aims to challenge cultures that silence women, striving to change cultural attitudes in real life, a long-term endeavor Omolola acknowledges. Members find a unique freedom and care in the group, feeling freer than ever before, as Omolola notes, \"they are suddenly in a space where people actually care what they have to say.\"\n\n    Chapter (Content) The Impact and Potential of Online Groups\n    Online groups significantly impact members' lives through mutual aid and support, yet understanding their full potential for connection, meaning, and thriving requires further research. This report introduces online group leaders as a new profession essential for creating inclusive spaces, highlighting the importance of diverse conversations on issues like wearing hijab, being visually impaired, or growing up Asian in fostering community. Successful leadership prevents discussions from deteriorating, underscoring the need for more research, specifically qualitative and quantitative, to explore members' sense of belonging and participation dynamics. The YouGov survey initiates this exploration, but additional studies could better identify participants and how support from governments, civil society organizations, educational institutions, and philanthropists can enhance online communities. The shift of power from traditional institutions to more diffuse, technology-driven platforms, as discussed in Moses Naim's \"The End of Power,\" suggests a need for thoughtful, ethical leadership within online groups. Understanding these dynamics demands more focused research on their operation and support mechanisms to maximize their impact online and offline.

It highlights how AI is being used to modernize legacy systems, improve public services, enhance citizen engagement, and solve complex problems. Examples include the use of AI in analyzing and modernizing COBOL code, creating more accessible government websites, aiding in environmental assessments, and improving public sector efficiency. The text also touches on the challenges of information overload and the potential of AI to make sense of vast amounts of data, thereby enabling better decision-making and public participation. It concludes with a call for government agencies to adopt AI to enhance public engagement and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Leveraging Generative AI for Modernizing Legacy Code and Enhancing Software Development\n    ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, Pi, and similar AI platforms analyze, summarize, and create text and software code, aiding governments in updating and scrutinizing old computer languages like COBOL, dating back to 1959, essential for public systems but lacking experts.\n\nNew Jersey's Office of Innovation, with engineers, designers, and policy professionals, uses generative AI to examine and modernize outdated government systems. Engineers use \"copilot\" tools for suggestions, yielding up to 55% faster code creation, akin to email autocomplete. They also employ ChatGPT for software test writing, boosting digital application resilience. Image generation platforms like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E interpret and explain images besides creating them, for instance, suggesting meals from refrigerator images.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Transforming the Public Sector with AI: A Path to Conversational Government\n    Despite funding the Internet's creation, the public sector was slow to adopt it but now has a chance to pioneer AI for public benefit. AI can revolutionize government-public interaction through its ability to process and simplify large data sets, making government information, often hidden in complex websites and PDFs, more accessible.\n\nPublic knowledge is vast but fragmented, with scientific publications and web communication increasing, ironically making mutual understanding harder. A decade ago, 1.8 million scientific articles were published annually, a number that has grown, while the web has both facilitated and complicated communication.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s 2008 transition team's call for public ideas, receiving 125,000 people's 44,000 suggestions, highlighted the difficulty of managing excessive input, embodying the \"dog chases ambulance\" adage.\n\nAI can enhance service delivery, support public workers, improve data use, boost engagement, and increase problem-solving by making public and institutional voices clearer. The following sections briefly discuss AI's potential to improve customer experience in government.\n\n1. MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE INTELLIGIBLE: CREATING CONVERSATIONAL GOVERNMENT\n\n    Chapter (Summary) Enhancing Public Engagement and Problem Solving with AI\n    The text discusses the overwhelming amount of information and misinformation on the web, particularly in the context of public comments on federal regulations, using the 2017 Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality comments as an example. It introduces AI as a solution to effectively manage and analyze public input, highlighting various AI tools and platforms like de-duplication software, Citizen Lab, Your Priorities, Cortico, ChatGPT, Anthropic, and UrbanistAI that facilitate public engagement, policy making, and citizen collaboration. The text also covers the use of AI in addressing complex problems like election subversion, showcasing the Policy Synth toolkit for smarter crowdsourcing and policy making. It emphasizes AI's potential in enhancing public consultations, solving complex problems, and fostering a new era of citizen collaboration.\n\n      Chapter (Content) The Challenge of Public Comments in the Digital Age\n      The Web and social media has often left us drowning in too much information and misinformation, making it hard for agencies and the public to discern genuine dialogue. The 1946 Administrative Procedure Act granted Americans the right to comment on pending federal regulations. In 2017, the FCC issued a draft regulation on Internet neutrality seeking to overturn an Obama-era rule, receiving 22 million comments. Only 6% were unique; 94% were duplicates, some submitted hundreds of thousands of times, many under false names, including 7 million from one account. Even with \"only\" 1.32 million non-duplicates, that number is too many for the public or policymakers to read.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Enhancing Public Engagement with AI Tools\n      AI tools not only make public input more manageable but also help both the public and institutions understand it, fostering broad participation and oversight in agency AI use. Generative AI aids in removing duplicates and extracting unique comments for crafting regulations. Citizen Lab's AI, utilized by over 500 governments, clusters, groups, and organizes public comments for better engagement. Hamburg's DIPAS uses natural language processing for city planning feedback, capable of processing Plattdeutsch dialect, local acronyms, and planning jargon.\n\nYour Priorities, a free, open-source tool by Citizens Foundation, used globally in thousands of engagements, employs AI to scan for toxicity and automate moderation, reducing costs. It identifies speech violating terms and norms, bringing it to moderators' attention. Leveraging ChatGPT, it summarizes key ideas, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements, enhancing discussions and policy development.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Leveraging Machine Learning for Community Engagement and Language Assistance\n      At MIT, the Cortico project uses machine learning to synthesize comments in live, face-to-face discussions. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, small groups of citizens participated in community conversations about the city\u2019s police, which had come under scrutiny for violence against Black residents. The conversations were recorded using Cortico. The machine learning tool highlighted topics of common concern and these became the basis for interview questions for the four finalists for the chief of police job.\n\nFor those who struggle with language barriers, tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic can translate poorly worded ideas into well-crafted contributions. Those not fluent in the dominant language or who are simply not good writers can turn a vague idea into clear, clean prose. Prompt one of these free genAI tools to write a fifty-word proposal for a plastic bag tax and the machine returns: \u201cTo combat plastic pollution, we propose implementing a bag tax. Data shows that after Ireland introduced a \u20ac0.15 tax in 2002, plastic bag usage dropped ninety percent within a year, significantly reducing litter and promoting reusable bags. This tax would encourage sustainable behavior, cut landfill waste, and generate revenue for environmental projects.\u201d\n\n\n      Chapter (Content) AI in Urban Planning: Fostering Citizen Engagement and Visualizing Future Cities\n      UrbanistAI, a Finnish-Italian initiative, enables citizen engagement by transforming public urban design ideas into hyper-realistic images, including specific changes like adding planters or converting roads into pedestrian zones in Helsinki.

This shift introduced new buzzwords, redefining our work with municipalities and ministries on city design.\n\nHistorical urban visions like Howard's Garden City and Wright's Broadacre City, not always fully realized, influenced global urban planning with their social roots, contrasting with today's market-driven visions that often neglect local needs. This transition from socially rooted to financially motivated visions risks ignoring genuine community demands, with many projects failing due to lack of financial or public support.\n\nThe Toronto waterfront project by Google exemplifies such failures, where its marketability ignored critical needs like affordable housing. Sidewalk Labs' controversial proposal to use Toronto's property taxes for the project raised privacy and taxpayer money concerns, misaligning with community priorities. Similarly, Saudi Arabia's Neom project, despite scaling back ambitions, reflects urban visions serving political interests over community needs, highlighting a trend of visions being used for political display rather than fulfilling community demands.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Reimagining Participatory Planning with AI and Collective Intelligence\n  We transformed participatory planning, making stakeholders active creators to address public demands for collaborative processes and correct the media representation imbalance between professionals and citizens.\n\nWe leveraged imagery in participatory planning, enabling all to co-design future visions with AI. We adopted collective intelligence, as defined by Geoff Mulgan, to foster inclusive design and dialogue.\n\nIn 2020, our Narva project illustrated this approach, with citizens using images to discuss and design futures, culminating in a designer sketching these visions. This initiative, before AI, led to a collective vision now incorporated into Narva's master plan, demonstrating the effectiveness of a shared language in enabling change.\n\nOur first AI-assisted project was the High Street redesign in a northern city in Finland, merging citizens' insights with technical expertise, illustrating AI's role in participatory planning.\n\nIn 2021, the challenge extended beyond AI's negative image to convincing entities of the value of in-person participation over online forms, despite AI's daunting perception.\n\nBy 2023, familiarity with technologies like GPT improved AI's image, prompting us to expand our work with cities and ministries. Participants, initially proposing basic improvements, used AI to develop complex solutions. They evaluated these ideas in real settings, incorporating blindfolds for unique assessments, and digitally, showcasing human-AI collaboration. This led to a final vote and debate on preferred visions. The mayor of Pristina's future communications about citizen-designed spaces, initiating their development, exemplifies the impact of our participatory planning approach.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Innovative Participatory Urban Planning and Design Model\n  The text outlines a comprehensive approach to participatory urban planning and design, emphasizing the importance of in-person engagement for meaningful participation.

The text concludes with examples of community engagement events in Cleveland and Berlin, demonstrating the model's flexibility and effectiveness in urban planning and design.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Urban Development and Community Engagement through Urban SDI and Generative AI\n    In 2023, we applied his model in Helsinki, initiating a construction project using urban SDI to reshape the city. We collaborated with organizations focused on economy and climate history, advancing the model and training professionals in generative AI for citizen engagement. Similarly, the Mohammed bin Rashid initiative trained planners in AI for local community and stakeholder engagement. Despite our academic origins, the project, only 1.5 years old, has begun influencing academic literature, showing that such visual tools not only aid our project but also increase citizen support. Over the past year, over 30 cities and organizations have adopted our approach for co-design and planning, leading to tangible projects I'm now ready to showcase.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Engaging Young Minds in Urban Planning through AI\n    Excited to share AI platform applications across various contexts and audiences, starting with child-focused projects. Customized the platform for children, simplifying and adding gamification. The first project in Canberra, funded by architects in Europe, aimed to develop child-centric design methodologies. Children from a Canberra schoolyard contributed ideas for its transformation, engaging in three interaction types: selecting from printed photo options, drawing their ideas, and directly using AI to explore options, all followed by group voting. The key takeaway is the value of human interaction enhanced by technology.\n\nThe next project, \"Children and Urban Planners\" during a digital week at the Leonardo da Vinci Museum, involved children and parents learning about urban planning. Discussions on urban living challenges led to hands-on tasks like redesigning a Milan schoolyard, using iPads, mobiles, and printed options for creativity. The workshop emphasized civic engagement, concluding with a discussion and vote on future city elements.\n\nDocument: AI's role in enhancing democracy and tackling election subversion.\nURL: https://rebootdemocracy.ai/blog/AI-restore-faith-in-democracy\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Enhancing Policymaking with AI: The Case of Policy Synth\n  The text discusses the development and application of 'Policy Synth,' a tool that leverages GPT-4, a multimodal large language model by Open AI, to enhance the process of policymaking.

This transition from socially rooted to financially motivated visions risks ignoring genuine community demands, with many projects failing due to lack of financial or public support.\n\nThe Toronto waterfront project by Google exemplifies such failures, where its marketability ignored critical needs like affordable housing. Sidewalk Labs' controversial proposal to use Toronto's property taxes for the project raised privacy and taxpayer money concerns, misaligning with community priorities. Similarly, Saudi Arabia's Neom project, despite scaling back ambitions, reflects urban visions serving political interests over community needs, highlighting a trend of visions being used for political display rather than fulfilling community demands.\n\n  Chapter (Content) Reimagining Participatory Planning with AI and Collective Intelligence\n  We transformed participatory planning, making stakeholders active creators to address public demands for collaborative processes and correct the media representation imbalance between professionals and citizens.\n\nWe leveraged imagery in participatory planning, enabling all to co-design future visions with AI. We adopted collective intelligence, as defined by Geoff Mulgan, to foster inclusive design and dialogue.\n\nIn 2020, our Narva project illustrated this approach, with citizens using images to discuss and design futures, culminating in a designer sketching these visions. This initiative, before AI, led to a collective vision now incorporated into Narva's master plan, demonstrating the effectiveness of a shared language in enabling change.\n\nOur first AI-assisted project was the High Street redesign in a northern city in Finland, merging citizens' insights with technical expertise, illustrating AI's role in participatory planning.\n\nIn 2021, the challenge extended beyond AI's negative image to convincing entities of the value of in-person participation over online forms, despite AI's daunting perception.\n\nBy 2023, familiarity with technologies like GPT improved AI's image, prompting us to expand our work with cities and ministries. Participants, initially proposing basic improvements, used AI to develop complex solutions. They evaluated these ideas in real settings, incorporating blindfolds for unique assessments, and digitally, showcasing human-AI collaboration. This led to a final vote and debate on preferred visions. The mayor of Pristina's future communications about citizen-designed spaces, initiating their development, exemplifies the impact of our participatory planning approach.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Innovative Participatory Urban Planning and Design Model\n  The text outlines a comprehensive approach to participatory urban planning and design, emphasizing the importance of in-person engagement for meaningful participation. It details the implementation of a model that prioritizes small group deliberations over large online surveys, highlighting its success in fostering engagement and tangible outcomes such as new projects, relationships, and strengthened local networks. The model's application in Helsinki for a construction project marks its first utilization in reshaping urban environments. The text also covers the use of generative AI in training designers, planners, and architects to better connect with citizens, mentioning a collaboration with the Mohammed bin Rashid central economy innovation. Several projects are described, showcasing the model's application in various contexts, including workshops with children in Canberra and Milan, the Helsinki Summit Street project involving diverse citizen groups, and placemaking workshops in different cities. The text concludes with examples of community engagement events in Cleveland and Berlin, demonstrating the model's flexibility and effectiveness in urban planning and design.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Urban Development and Community Engagement through Urban SDI and Generative AI\n    In 2023, we applied his model in Helsinki, initiating a construction project using urban SDI to reshape the city. We collaborated with organizations focused on economy and climate history, advancing the model and training professionals in generative AI for citizen engagement. Similarly, the Mohammed bin Rashid initiative trained planners in AI for local community and stakeholder engagement. Despite our academic origins, the project, only 1.5 years old, has begun influencing academic literature, showing that such visual tools not only aid our project but also increase citizen support. Over the past year, over 30 cities and organizations have adopted our approach for co-design and planning, leading to tangible projects I'm now ready to showcase.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Engaging Young Minds in Urban Planning through AI\n    Excited to share AI platform applications across various contexts and audiences, starting with child-focused projects. Customized the platform for children, simplifying and adding gamification. The first project in Canberra, funded by architects in Europe, aimed to develop child-centric design methodologies. Children from a Canberra schoolyard contributed ideas for its transformation, engaging in three interaction types: selecting from printed photo options, drawing their ideas, and directly using AI to explore options, all followed by group voting. The key takeaway is the value of human interaction enhanced by technology.\n\nThe next project, \"Children and Urban Planners\" during a digital week at the Leonardo da Vinci Museum, involved children and parents learning about urban planning. Discussions on urban living challenges led to hands-on tasks like redesigning a Milan schoolyard, using iPads, mobiles, and printed options for creativity. The workshop emphasized civic engagement, concluding with a discussion and vote on future city elements.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Leveraging AI and Participatory Planning for Urban Development\n  The text outlines various urban development and planning projects that leverage participatory planning and AI to engage communities in envisioning and shaping their environments. It discusses experiments and workshops in cities like Zurich, Helsinki, Berlin, and initiatives in Indonesia and Panama, focusing on climate change impacts, urban greening, and community engagement in planning processes. The projects aim to foster democratic participation, leveraging technology to visualize potential urban transformations and facilitate discussions on sustainable and inclusive urban development. The text also addresses challenges such as balancing engineering constraints with participatory design, ensuring meaningful community engagement, and managing biases in AI-driven tools.\n\n    Chapter (Content) UNDP Community Engagement Events in Indonesia and Panama\n    UNDP accelerator labs hosted an event in Indonesia to engage the local community in the development of Muslim Bora, Indonesia's future capital, focusing on design guidelines for public parks and residential areas. A design charrette in East Kalimantan with stakeholders, indigenous communities, and employers aimed at establishing principles for quality public spaces and housing, using community mood boards for conceptual visualizations. The project continues.\n\nA UNDP-organized educational workshop in Panama involved 62 teenagers in assessing climate change impacts and visualizing mitigation strategies by transforming photos of their streets to show potential effects of floods, hurricanes, or wildfires. These visualizations, not precise but meant to spark discussion on potential impacts and mitigation, emphasize the power of seeing one's street transformed by disaster to initiate conversations on prevention and mitigation. The workshop is ongoing, and we invite online questions or comments.\n\nThe question about engineering visual gyms underscores the challenge of integrating design principles and budgets to create feasible and impactful projects, asking for strategies to achieve this balance.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Collaborative Workshops in Urban Planning: Engaging Stakeholders and Utilizing AI\n    Our first workshop in Helsinki focused on a tight three-month timeline for constructing two streets, emphasizing the need for specialized tools for citizen engagement, cost estimation by engineers, and budget planning by city planners, all of whom attended. We facilitate knowledge transfer, training organizations like the CTO to use Rubenstein, providing tools for interaction, deliberation, and technical queries related to budgets and design.\n\nThe second question highlights the importance of real-world design and human interaction in workshops, requiring weeks for a meaningful democratic process, contrasting with superficial AI-driven sessions. The Panama workshop involved extensive preparation on climate disasters and AI training, underscoring the effort and collaboration needed.\n\nWe tailor the workshop interface to its goals, supporting the facilitating team rather than leading. The discussion extends to scenario planning, pre-planning activities with participants, and the efficient use of AI in these settings, questioning the mechanics of AI deployment for effective outcomes.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Methodologies and Preparations for Urban Planning Workshops\n    Our sessions last four hours, either continuously or in parts, tailored to the organization's needs. We offer three methodologies: construction-focused workshops, participatory planning for urban vision without construction, and broader engagement on city changes without climate action. Preparation varies by workshop type; for instance, Helsinki's construction project required extensive preparation with engineers and specialists, training them in specific tools and setting up a detailed workshop plan.\n\nWork complexity varies; in Berlin, citizens reimagine neighborhoods with a simpler process. They use preloaded or personal photos to select transformations, requiring no prep beyond sharing a QR code for photo selection and transformation prompts.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Engaging Communities Online: Balancing Scale and Meaningful Participation\n    The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online engagement, like virtual stickies, underscoring the need for collaboration with tech experts and simple user interactions, such as photo uploads, which can both encourage and discourage participation depending on the project. The initiative, already active in Zurich with potential for other cities, explores managing diverse interaction levels and community engagement with AI, including developing a scale for citizens' participatory planning. It aims to simplify access for all audiences, with the technical team successfully creating tailored platforms for various use cases, from small workshops to city-wide participation. The project values small group debates, where meaningful participation and innovation result from compromises among differing opinions, thus preferring small-scale interactions to maintain the integrity of democratic processes. This approach reflects a nuanced strategy for engagement and scaling, inviting feedback on its effectiveness and scalability.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Collective Intelligence in Urban Planning: A Helsinki Case Study\n    Designs evolve with user input, yet decision-making is tough for both citizens and engineers, often causing project failures. Collective intelligence merges technical and non-technical insights, weeding out poor ideas and sparking innovation. In Helsinki, a bike lane project was initially rejected to save 18th-century cobblestones, yet another project led to outrage by destroying a historic street, underscoring the value of diverse contributions in spotting and debating flaws.\n\nIn Helsinki, AI tools match drivers with cyclists in citizen assemblies, fostering compromises by blending divergent views. This strategy integrates stakeholders\u2014citizens, investors, advocates\u2014into unified groups, avoiding traditional segmentation, and aiming for inclusive solutions. It addresses opposition to sustainable practices like green space preservation by leveraging broad input.\n\nThis method doesn't supplant but augments traditional engagement, stressing the necessity of human interaction, debate, and compromise. Technology facilitates, but doesn't replace, the essence of meaningful participation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Client Engagement and Experience in Technology Implementation\n    Who's your main client for this tool, given your work with various groups like municipalities and nonprofits? Have architects and planners used it, and which groups are more or less receptive?\n\nInitially, national ministries and organizations were most receptive due to early AI policy familiarity, making them our first clients. Now, focus has shifted towards cities, with municipalities and universities keen on custom tech deployment methods. We aim to involve local activists and building associations, with growth driven by non-aggressive sales, corporate programs, and national funding.\n\nClient engagement prioritizes shared missions over aggressive sales, fostering organic growth through aligned organization contacts, shaping operations for the past 18 months.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Urban Planning Technology in Cleveland: Opportunities and Challenges\n    Cleveland, in partnership with a local urban planning firm, is the sole U.S. city using this technology, aiming to expand in the U.S. despite a focus on Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nThis technology offers architects and urban planners a chance to enhance their roles in community engagement and mediation, emphasizing the importance of understanding its application to fulfill community needs. The speaker highlights the potential for positive impacts on social and ecological aspects of cities, acknowledging AI biases but noting the ability to adjust these biases to reflect community cultural preferences through local input.\n\nThe discussion shifts to addressing biases and privacy concerns related to sidewalk development and the use of community-provided photographs, stressing the need for clear privacy policies and guidelines in handling such information.\n\nDocument: Exploring AI's impact on participatory planning with UrbanistAI.\nURL: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ai-for-participatory-planning-with-urbanistai-tickets-846322462267?aff=oddtdtcreator\n\n  Chapter (Content) AI for Participatory Planning with UrbanistAI Event Announcement\n  AI for Participatory Planning with UrbanistAI, cohosted by Northeastern University's School of Architecture and The Burnes Center for Social Change, is on Thursday, April 11, 5-6:30pm EDT at Northeastern Center for Design, Ryder Hall, 11 Leon St #102, Boston, MA 02115, USA.\n\n  Chapter (Content) AI in Participatory Planning: A Conversation with Liza Gazeeva\n  The event features a talk with Liza Gazeeva on AI's role in participatory planning via UrbanistAI, a generative AI for city futures, blending AI with public input for better planning and policy.

The text also covers the use of AI in addressing complex problems like election subversion, showcasing the Policy Synth toolkit for smarter crowdsourcing and policy making. It emphasizes AI's potential in enhancing public consultations, solving complex problems, and fostering a new era of citizen collaboration.\n\n      Chapter (Content) The Challenge of Public Comments in the Digital Age\n      The Web and social media has often left us drowning in too much information and misinformation, making it hard for agencies and the public to discern genuine dialogue. The 1946 Administrative Procedure Act granted Americans the right to comment on pending federal regulations. In 2017, the FCC issued a draft regulation on Internet neutrality seeking to overturn an Obama-era rule, receiving 22 million comments. Only 6% were unique; 94% were duplicates, some submitted hundreds of thousands of times, many under false names, including 7 million from one account. Even with \"only\" 1.32 million non-duplicates, that number is too many for the public or policymakers to read.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Enhancing Public Engagement with AI Tools\n      AI tools not only make public input more manageable but also help both the public and institutions understand it, fostering broad participation and oversight in agency AI use. Generative AI aids in removing duplicates and extracting unique comments for crafting regulations. Citizen Lab's AI, utilized by over 500 governments, clusters, groups, and organizes public comments for better engagement. Hamburg's DIPAS uses natural language processing for city planning feedback, capable of processing Plattdeutsch dialect, local acronyms, and planning jargon.\n\nYour Priorities, a free, open-source tool by Citizens Foundation, used globally in thousands of engagements, employs AI to scan for toxicity and automate moderation, reducing costs. It identifies speech violating terms and norms, bringing it to moderators' attention. Leveraging ChatGPT, it summarizes key ideas, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements, enhancing discussions and policy development.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Leveraging Machine Learning for Community Engagement and Language Assistance\n      At MIT, the Cortico project uses machine learning to synthesize comments in live, face-to-face discussions. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, small groups of citizens participated in community conversations about the city\u2019s police, which had come under scrutiny for violence against Black residents. The conversations were recorded using Cortico. The machine learning tool highlighted topics of common concern and these became the basis for interview questions for the four finalists for the chief of police job.\n\nFor those who struggle with language barriers, tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic can translate poorly worded ideas into well-crafted contributions. Those not fluent in the dominant language or who are simply not good writers can turn a vague idea into clear, clean prose. Prompt one of these free genAI tools to write a fifty-word proposal for a plastic bag tax and the machine returns: \u201cTo combat plastic pollution, we propose implementing a bag tax. Data shows that after Ireland introduced a \u20ac0.15 tax in 2002, plastic bag usage dropped ninety percent within a year, significantly reducing litter and promoting reusable bags. This tax would encourage sustainable behavior, cut landfill waste, and generate revenue for environmental projects.\u201d\n\n\n      Chapter (Content) AI in Urban Planning: Fostering Citizen Engagement and Visualizing Future Cities\n      UrbanistAI, a Finnish-Italian initiative, enables citizen engagement by transforming public urban design ideas into hyper-realistic images, including specific changes like adding planters or converting roads into pedestrian zones in Helsinki. It supports global co-design workshops and incorporates a voting feature for community input, making urban planning accessible to all.\n\nSince 2022, Car Free America, an urban planning activist's initiative, has been sharing AI-generated images on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, depicting car-less, human-centered downtown visions for cities like Cincinnati, Fort Wayne, and Austin, heralding a new era of inclusive, diverse citizen collaboration and co-design.\n\nDocument: AI's role in enhancing democracy and tackling election subversion.\nURL: https://rebootdemocracy.ai/blog/AI-restore-faith-in-democracy\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Enhancing Policymaking with AI: The Case of Policy Synth\n  The text discusses the development and application of 'Policy Synth,' a tool that leverages GPT-4, a multimodal large language model by Open AI, to enhance the process of policymaking. It automates the generation of search queries to identify problems and their root causes, focusing on 'election subversion' as a case study. The tool breaks down complex issues into smaller, more manageable challenges and uses AI to propose solutions. A notable feature is the use of a genetic algorithm to evolve recommendations, ensuring they are well-suited to address the identified problems. Additionally, Policy Synth employs Elo Scoring to rank solutions based on various criteria. The text highlights the benefits of combining AI with human expertise to accelerate the evaluation of evidence and decision-making processes, especially in contexts involving taxpayer money and public participation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Policy Synth: Enhancing Policymaking with GPT-4\n    Together, we created a toolkit using an enhanced GPT-4 from Open AI, a multimodal large language model, to boost \"smarter crowdsourcing\" in speed, accuracy, and scale for advanced policymaking. Policy Synth employs AI to automate over a thousand search queries, from general to scientific, to data-specific and news-related, thoroughly exploring problems and their roots, breaking \"election subversion\" into several dozen smaller, manageable challenges.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Addressing Legal System Misuse through Specialist Conferences and AI\n    Selected topics for focus included administrative and legal system misuse by election deniers through malicious lawsuits and frivolous public records requests to disrupt election systems.\n\nConvened 35 specialists for a two-hour Zoom conference, proposing 14 solutions to legal abuse, including disciplining malicious lawyers and enhancing law school education on professional responsibility. AI summarized learnings from the conference quickly, enabling repetition for other topics.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Use of AI in Generating Solutions for Philanthropy\n    We asked Policy Synth and GPT agents to search the web, identifying hundreds of solutions responsive to the problem. After automating the removal of duplicates and filtering for philanthropy relevance, not governments or companies, Robert's \"reaping\" process isolated relevant solutions.\n\n\"Reaping\" yielded 60 philanthropy-focused solutions per issue, each with StabilityAI visuals, in a human-readable format, detailing pros and cons.\n\nPolicy Synth matched 14 expert-identified solutions to legal abuses and added unique ones, like a legal defense fund and mental health support for election workers.\n\nPolicy Synth refines solutions using a genetic algorithm, combining and testing recommendations over fifteen rounds of mutation and ranking, producing a final list of tailored approaches for each problem.\n\nRecently, Google\u2019s Deepmind announced its experimentation with genetic algorithms to improve AI's prompt drafting, marking a recent development in AI research.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Using Elo Scoring in Policy Synth for Solution Ranking\n    Policy Synth employs Elo Scoring, originating from chess to assess player skill through the quality of opponents, to rank solutions. Additionally, it evaluates solutions based on criteria like speed, cost, political disagreement, and impact on specific groups, including women and African Americans.\n\nThis method allows for mutual rating and ranking of AI and human expert proposals, leveraging generative AI to quickly sift and rank ideas, thus accelerating evidence evaluation. It helps avoid biases related to the proposer's identity, common in large group discussions.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Enhancing Citizen Engagement in Decision-Making with AI\n    Robert stresses the importance of public involvement in decisions involving taxpayer money but notes the administrative challenges of managing public input limit participation and issue scope. He highlights AI's transformative role in overcoming these barriers by automating tasks like research and evaluation, thus expanding participation in online engagements. AI enhances the process by analyzing conversations, evaluating contributions, refining proposals, and conducting gap-filling research, allowing for efficient integration of various citizen engagement stages, even with large participant numbers.",

This led to a final vote and debate on preferred visions. The mayor of Pristina's future communications about citizen-designed spaces, initiating their development, exemplifies the impact of our participatory planning approach.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Innovative Participatory Urban Planning and Design Model\n  The text outlines a comprehensive approach to participatory urban planning and design, emphasizing the importance of in-person engagement for meaningful participation. It details the implementation of a model that prioritizes small group deliberations over large online surveys, highlighting its success in fostering engagement and tangible outcomes such as new projects, relationships, and strengthened local networks. The model's application in Helsinki for a construction project marks its first utilization in reshaping urban environments. The text also covers the use of generative AI in training designers, planners, and architects to better connect with citizens, mentioning a collaboration with the Mohammed bin Rashid central economy innovation. Several projects are described, showcasing the model's application in various contexts, including workshops with children in Canberra and Milan, the Helsinki Summit Street project involving diverse citizen groups, and placemaking workshops in different cities. The text concludes with examples of community engagement events in Cleveland and Berlin, demonstrating the model's flexibility and effectiveness in urban planning and design.\n\n    Chapter (Content) The Value of In-Person Engagement for Meaningful Participation\n    We meet in person because meaningful participation requires the \"team human\" agenda: think constructively, connect meaningfully. Real space interaction is essential, despite higher costs than online surveys, because it fosters genuine connections and debates. We've shifted from large online surveys to engaging small groups (50-100 people) effectively, leading to engagement, project development, new relationships, and stronger community bonds.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Urban Development and Community Engagement through Urban SDI and Generative AI\n    In 2023, we applied his model in Helsinki, initiating a construction project using urban SDI to reshape the city. We collaborated with organizations focused on economy and climate history, advancing the model and training professionals in generative AI for citizen engagement. Similarly, the Mohammed bin Rashid initiative trained planners in AI for local community and stakeholder engagement. Despite our academic origins, the project, only 1.5 years old, has begun influencing academic literature, showing that such visual tools not only aid our project but also increase citizen support. Over the past year, over 30 cities and organizations have adopted our approach for co-design and planning, leading to tangible projects I'm now ready to showcase.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Engaging Young Minds in Urban Planning through AI\n    Excited to share AI platform applications across various contexts and audiences, starting with child-focused projects. Customized the platform for children, simplifying and adding gamification. The first project in Canberra, funded by architects in Europe, aimed to develop child-centric design methodologies. Children from a Canberra schoolyard contributed ideas for its transformation, engaging in three interaction types: selecting from printed photo options, drawing their ideas, and directly using AI to explore options, all followed by group voting. The key takeaway is the value of human interaction enhanced by technology.\n\nThe next project, \"Children and Urban Planners\" during a digital week at the Leonardo da Vinci Museum, involved children and parents learning about urban planning. Discussions on urban living challenges led to hands-on tasks like redesigning a Milan schoolyard, using iPads, mobiles, and printed options for creativity. The workshop emphasized civic engagement, concluding with a discussion and vote on future city elements.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Inclusive Urban Planning through Placemaking: Case Studies\n    We discussed placemaking use cases, including Helsinki's project to pedestrianize three main streets in summer, involving citizens of diverse ages, backgrounds, and abilities in planning. Groups formed scenarios for street use, which were then discussed and voted on with urban planners.\n\nA visually impaired woman and her daughter provided key insights, receiving the most votes, while a hard-of-hearing participant also contributed significantly. The project, highlighting inclusivity in urban planning, saw citizen-voted ideas, like parklets and public seating, implemented in 2003, with the Helsinki Design Museum showcasing these post-construction.\n\nAnother placemaking example was a co-designed residential area workshop with the city mayor, starting with a children's playground and planning future developments.\n\n  Chapter (Summary) Leveraging AI and Participatory Planning for Urban Development\n  The text outlines various urban development and planning projects that leverage participatory planning and AI to engage communities in envisioning and shaping their environments.

We offer three methodologies: construction-focused workshops, participatory planning for urban vision without construction, and broader engagement on city changes without climate action. Preparation varies by workshop type; for instance, Helsinki's construction project required extensive preparation with engineers and specialists, training them in specific tools and setting up a detailed workshop plan.\n\nWork complexity varies; in Berlin, citizens reimagine neighborhoods with a simpler process. They use preloaded or personal photos to select transformations, requiring no prep beyond sharing a QR code for photo selection and transformation prompts.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Engaging Communities Online: Balancing Scale and Meaningful Participation\n    The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online engagement, like virtual stickies, underscoring the need for collaboration with tech experts and simple user interactions, such as photo uploads, which can both encourage and discourage participation depending on the project. The initiative, already active in Zurich with potential for other cities, explores managing diverse interaction levels and community engagement with AI, including developing a scale for citizens' participatory planning. It aims to simplify access for all audiences, with the technical team successfully creating tailored platforms for various use cases, from small workshops to city-wide participation. The project values small group debates, where meaningful participation and innovation result from compromises among differing opinions, thus preferring small-scale interactions to maintain the integrity of democratic processes. This approach reflects a nuanced strategy for engagement and scaling, inviting feedback on its effectiveness and scalability.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Collective Intelligence in Urban Planning: A Helsinki Case Study\n    Designs evolve with user input, yet decision-making is tough for both citizens and engineers, often causing project failures. Collective intelligence merges technical and non-technical insights, weeding out poor ideas and sparking innovation. In Helsinki, a bike lane project was initially rejected to save 18th-century cobblestones, yet another project led to outrage by destroying a historic street, underscoring the value of diverse contributions in spotting and debating flaws.\n\nIn Helsinki, AI tools match drivers with cyclists in citizen assemblies, fostering compromises by blending divergent views. This strategy integrates stakeholders\u2014citizens, investors, advocates\u2014into unified groups, avoiding traditional segmentation, and aiming for inclusive solutions. It addresses opposition to sustainable practices like green space preservation by leveraging broad input.\n\nThis method doesn't supplant but augments traditional engagement, stressing the necessity of human interaction, debate, and compromise. Technology facilitates, but doesn't replace, the essence of meaningful participation.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Client Engagement and Experience in Technology Implementation\n    Who's your main client for this tool, given your work with various groups like municipalities and nonprofits? Have architects and planners used it, and which groups are more or less receptive?\n\nInitially, national ministries and organizations were most receptive due to early AI policy familiarity, making them our first clients. Now, focus has shifted towards cities, with municipalities and universities keen on custom tech deployment methods. We aim to involve local activists and building associations, with growth driven by non-aggressive sales, corporate programs, and national funding.\n\nClient engagement prioritizes shared missions over aggressive sales, fostering organic growth through aligned organization contacts, shaping operations for the past 18 months.\n\n    Chapter (Content) Innovative Urban Planning Technology in Cleveland: Opportunities and Challenges\n    Cleveland, in partnership with a local urban planning firm, is the sole U.S. city using this technology, aiming to expand in the U.S. despite a focus on Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.\n\nThis technology offers architects and urban planners a chance to enhance their roles in community engagement and mediation, emphasizing the importance of understanding its application to fulfill community needs.

The 1946 Administrative Procedure Act granted Americans the right to comment on pending federal regulations. In 2017, the FCC issued a draft regulation on Internet neutrality seeking to overturn an Obama-era rule, receiving 22 million comments. Only 6% were unique; 94% were duplicates, some submitted hundreds of thousands of times, many under false names, including 7 million from one account. Even with \"only\" 1.32 million non-duplicates, that number is too many for the public or policymakers to read.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Enhancing Public Engagement with AI Tools\n      AI tools not only make public input more manageable but also help both the public and institutions understand it, fostering broad participation and oversight in agency AI use. Generative AI aids in removing duplicates and extracting unique comments for crafting regulations. Citizen Lab's AI, utilized by over 500 governments, clusters, groups, and organizes public comments for better engagement. Hamburg's DIPAS uses natural language processing for city planning feedback, capable of processing Plattdeutsch dialect, local acronyms, and planning jargon.\n\nYour Priorities, a free, open-source tool by Citizens Foundation, used globally in thousands of engagements, employs AI to scan for toxicity and automate moderation, reducing costs. It identifies speech violating terms and norms, bringing it to moderators' attention. Leveraging ChatGPT, it summarizes key ideas, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements, enhancing discussions and policy development.\n\n      Chapter (Content) Leveraging Machine Learning for Community Engagement and Language Assistance\n      At MIT, the Cortico project uses machine learning to synthesize comments in live, face-to-face discussions. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, small groups of citizens participated in community conversations about the city\u2019s police, which had come under scrutiny for violence against Black residents. The conversations were recorded using Cortico. The machine learning tool highlighted topics of common concern and these became the basis for interview questions for the four finalists for the chief of police job.\n\nFor those who struggle with language barriers, tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic can translate poorly worded ideas into well-crafted contributions. Those not fluent in the dominant language or who are simply not good writers can turn a vague idea into clear, clean prose. Prompt one of these free genAI tools to write a fifty-word proposal for a plastic bag tax and the machine returns: \u201cTo combat plastic pollution, we propose implementing a bag tax. Data shows that after Ireland introduced a \u20ac0.15 tax in 2002, plastic bag usage dropped ninety percent within a year, significantly reducing litter and promoting reusable bags. This tax would encourage sustainable behavior, cut landfill waste, and generate revenue for environmental projects.\u201d\n\n\n      Chapter (Content) AI in Urban Planning: Fostering Citizen Engagement and Visualizing Future Cities\n      UrbanistAI, a Finnish-Italian initiative, enables citizen engagement by transforming public urban design ideas into hyper-realistic images, including specific changes like adding planters or converting roads into pedestrian zones in Helsinki.
