# PsSubProblems

`PsSubProblems` is a custom element that extends `PsStageBase` to manage and display sub-problems within a larger problem-solving context. It handles the lifecycle events to interact with global application states and renders sub-problems based on the current state.

## Properties

No public properties are explicitly defined in this class beyond those inherited from `PsStageBase` and those managed by LitElement (e.g., through `@property` decorators).

## Methods

| Name                  | Parameters                                      | Return Type | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| connectedCallback     |                                                 | void        | Extends the base class method to perform actions when the element is added to the document's DOM. |
| updated               | changedProperties: Map<string \| number \| symbol, unknown> | void        | Extends the base class method to perform actions on element updates.        |
| disconnectedCallback  |                                                 | void        | Extends the base class method to perform cleanup when the element is removed from the document's DOM. |
| render                |                                                 | unknown     | Renders the sub-problems or a specific sub-problem screen based on the current state. |
| renderSubProblemScreen| subProblem: PsSubProblem                   | unknown     | Renders the detailed view for a specific sub-problem.                       |
| renderSubProblemList  | (Inherited from PsStageBase)                    | unknown     | Renders a list of sub-problems. This method is assumed to be inherited and not explicitly defined in this class. |
| renderSubProblem      | (Inherited from PsStageBase)                    | unknown     | Renders a single sub-problem. This method is assumed to be inherited and not explicitly defined in this class. |
| renderSearchQueries   | (Inherited from PsStageBase)                    | unknown     | Renders search queries related to a sub-problem. This method is assumed to be inherited and not explicitly defined in this class. |
| renderSearchResults   | (Inherited from PsStageBase)                    | unknown     | Renders search results for solutions to a sub-problem. This method is assumed to be inherited and not explicitly defined in this class. |

## Events

No custom events are explicitly defined in this class.

## Example

```typescript
import '@policysynth/webapp/policies/ps-sub-problems.js';

// Assuming you have a LitElement context
class ExampleElement extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`
      <ps-sub-problems></ps-sub-problems>
    `;
  }
}
customElements.define('example-element', ExampleElement);
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `ps-sub-problems` custom element within another LitElement-based component. It shows the basic inclusion and usage within a render method, assuming that the necessary project setup and imports are already in place.
