# Flexbox Literals

This TypeScript file defines a series of CSS template literals for flexbox layouts, factors, reverse layouts, positioning, and alignment. These literals are designed to be used with the `lit` library for defining component styles in LitElement-based web components.

## Properties

There are no explicit properties defined in this file as it primarily exports CSS template literals.

## Methods

There are no methods defined in this file.

## Events

There are no events defined in this file.

## Example

```typescript
import { Layouts, Factors, ReverseLayouts, Positioning, Alignment } from '@policysynth/webapp/flexbox-literals/classes.js';

// Example of using the exported CSS in a LitElement
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';

@customElement('my-flex-element')
class MyFlexElement extends LitElement {
  static styles = [Layouts, Factors, ReverseLayouts, Positioning, Alignment];

  render() {
    return html`
      <div class="layout horizontal">
        <div class="flex">Item 1</div>
        <div class="flex">Item 2</div>
        <div class="flex">Item 3</div>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to import and use the CSS template literals defined in the file within a LitElement component. The `Layouts`, `Factors`, `ReverseLayouts`, `Positioning`, and `Alignment` CSS literals are imported and applied as styles to the component. The `render` method then defines a simple flexbox layout with three items.
