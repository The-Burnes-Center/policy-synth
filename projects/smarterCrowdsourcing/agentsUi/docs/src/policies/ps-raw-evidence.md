# PsRawEvidence

This class represents the raw evidence component in the application. It extends `YpBaseElement` to leverage common functionalities and properties. The component is responsible for displaying raw evidence related to policies, including handling the loading of evidence, grouping evidence by type, and providing interactive elements to navigate through the evidence.

## Events

No custom events are documented.

## Example

```typescript
import '@policysynth/webapp/policies/ps-raw-evidence.js';

// Usage in a LitElement template
html`
  <ps-raw-evidence
    .memory=${this.memoryData}
    .policy=${this.policyData}
    .activeSubProblemIndex=${this.activeIndex}
  ></ps-raw-evidence>
`;
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `ps-raw-evidence` component within a LitElement template. The component requires `memory`, `policy`, and `activeSubProblemIndex` properties to be set for it to function correctly.
