## Events

This component does not define any custom events.

## Example

```typescript
import '@policysynth/webapp/policies/ps-solutions.js';

// Usage within a LitElement
html`
  <ps-solutions></ps-solutions>
`;
```

This example demonstrates how to import and use the `ps-solutions` component within another LitElement component.
